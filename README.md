# Office-supplies-analysis using Python
This project analyzes the inventory of an office supplies company.
# Company Background
Pens & Printers is a national office supplies chain. Currently, they send office supplies out of warehouses in four regions: East, West, South, and Central, and all four warehouses stock the same products. The Head of Sales thinks this leads to large amounts of unsold products in some locations.
